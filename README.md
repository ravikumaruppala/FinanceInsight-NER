# FinanceInsight-NER

## Project Overview
FinanceInsight-NER is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on
Named Entity Recognition (NER) for financial text data. The goal is to identify
key financial entities such as organizations, monetary values, financial ratios,
and economic indicators from unstructured financial documents.

## Mentorship
This project is developed under the mentorship of **Ms. Dikshita**, as part of
a guided learning and evaluation program.

## Objectives
- Collect and preprocess financial text data
- Apply domain-specific cleaning for financial terminology
- Explore and experiment with NER models for financial entities
- Evaluate model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NLP libraries (NLTK / spaCy / Transformers)
- Financial text datasets

## Current Progress
- Financial text preprocessing completed
- Exploratory Data Analysis performed
- Initial NER model experimentation implemented

## Repository Structure
- `infosys_intern (4).ipynb` → Main implementation notebook
- `README.md` → Project documentation

## Future Work
- Improve entity recognition accuracy
- Experiment with transformer-based financial models (FinBERT)
- Perform deeper error analysis and refinement
